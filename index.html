    <h2>The History</h2>
    <p>
      Experts do agree that the croissant was inspired by the Austrian kipfel, a
      crescent-shaped baked good featuring a generous amount of butter or lard
      and sometimes sugar and almonds. According to popular lore, the kipfel
      originated in 1683 as a comestible celebration of Austrian victory over
      the Ottomans at the siege of Vienna. The story follows that a baker, up
      early to make bread, saved the city when he heard the Turks tunneling
      underneath the city and sounded an alarm. The kipfel’s curved shape, said
      to mimic the crescent moon of the Ottoman flag, then would seem to pay
      poetic tribute to the indomitable spirit of a city that resisted a
      powerful invading force. But the kipfel existed long before the Ottoman
      siege of Vienna. A poem mentions it as one of the Christmas treats that
      Viennese bakers presented to Duke Leopold in 1227. Moon-shaped breads in
      general date back centuries earlier. Does the croissant’s Austrian
      ancestry belie its French fame? Of course not, says Jim Chevallier, an
      independent scholar and author of a book on croissant history. “The
      croissant began as the Austrian kipfel but became French the moment people
      began to make it with puffed pastry, which is a French innovation,” says
      Chevallier. “It has fully taken root in its adopted land.” Order a kipfel
      in Austria or Germany today and you’ll likely be handed a crescent-shaped
      cookie. Legend credits the French queen Marie Antoinette—homesick for a
      taste of her native Vienna—with introducing the kipfel, and thus the
      croissant, to France. But Chevallier sees no evidence to support this
      notion.
